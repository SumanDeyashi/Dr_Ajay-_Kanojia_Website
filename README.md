# Description:

When people land on your website, they want to know who you are, what you do, and whether you have the skills and qualities to work at their company. Sharing your life story isn't the primary objective of your bio, but rather showing visitors how you can help them; either by working with them one on one or by joining their ranks.

Most people use their About page to share a brief biography. This is the place to share the most important details that are relevant to your professional life:

- Your education
- Your skills and expertise
- Your latest job or project you worked on

You can also include a brief section about what matters most to you, what causes you believe in, and a few hobbies to make it more engaging and to show off your personality.
